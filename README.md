# ydLidarX4_arduino
getting yd lidar x4 up and running on arduino with an esp32

I am finding all kinds of problems with getting data from the X4 in a useable
way that does not involve a computer attached by usb. However, I have gotten it
to work and will continue to update this fun project as I have time.

I am using an esp32 developer module; 
              oled i2c 128 x 64 display; 
              3.3 - 5 volt bidirectional data converter; 
              5v power supply; 
              yd lidar x4
